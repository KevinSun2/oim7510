    # Functions and APIs

    This session moves between two notebooks. It opens with section 4 of notebook 3, `03-collections-and-apis.py`, then comes here for section 1, on functions. After the break it goes back for section 5 of notebook 3, the first requests to a server, and returns here for the rest: reading an API built for this course, and sending data to it.
