    # Lists and Records

    Sections 1 and 2 ran in your notebook last week, and here they get their names.
    Section 3 practises them. **Sections 4 and 5 are the new material.**

    | | |
    |---|---|
    | ✏️ | Your turn. Add cells with the **+** button |
    | 🚀 | This week's work |

    **How to work with your agent, in every ✏️ section.** The order matters, and it is the
    same order all term.

    1. **Try it yourself first.** If you cannot write the code, write the steps in words.
    2. **Then ask your agent**, and read what it gives you before you keep it.
    3. **If any line of its answer is unclear, ask it to explain that line.** Keep asking
       until you could write the same line tomorrow. An answer you cannot read is not an
       answer you can check.
    4. **Then ask which concepts its answer used**, and find those rows in the table
       below.

    **The course rules for your agent** are a block of text you paste once into marimo's
    **Settings > AI Features > Custom Rules**, and they make it do steps 3 and 4 without
    being asked. Download them from the course site, under Downloads. Nothing here is
    required.

    | `[16.75, 22.25, 25.00]` | a **list** | holding many values of one kind, in order |

    | `sum(charges)` | **many values into one number** | combining every item into a single result |
    | `sorted(charges, reverse=True)` | a **function**, and `reverse=True` is an **argument** | calling an operation somebody already wrote. The argument is what you hand it |

    # 3. ✏️ Your Turn

    Five short ones, each a small piece of code with something surprising in it. Every
    one already has its code in a cell, so there is nothing to copy.

    **How to work them**

    - **Run a cell:** click into it and press `Ctrl+Enter`, or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS.
    - **Add a cell:** hover between two cells and click the **+** button, or use the **+**
      at the bottom of the notebook.
    - **Write words instead of code:** add a cell, open its menu (the **⋮** at its right
      edge) and choose **Convert to Markdown cell**. Prose typed into a code cell turns
      the cell red and it stays broken until you convert it or delete it.
    - **`This variable is already defined in another cell`:** you are trying to give a name
      that already exists somewhere else in this notebook. Edit the cell that already has
      it, or pick a different name. marimo allows one definition per name in the whole
      file, which is what stops two cells from quietly disagreeing.
    - **If your number is not the one written under a question**, check your data before
      you check your code. Last week's Experiment 1 put 999.99 into the freight list on
      purpose and asked you to put it back.
    - **Stuck:** try it yourself first, then ask your agent and paste the error if there
      is one. Read its answer, ask it to explain any line you could not have written, and
      finish by asking which concepts it used. The four steps are at the top of this
      notebook.

    Two ways to put a list in order. They look alike and they do different things, and

    ## E · The price list that changed by itself

    A shop builds its sale prices from its regular prices, adds one more sale price, and
    the regular price list comes out wrong. Nobody touched it.

    1. **Run the cell below** and read what `prices` holds at the end.
    2. **Add a cell** that prints `prices is sale_prices`. That is Python's way of asking
       whether two names refer to one single list, and it answers `True` or `False`.
    3. **Edit the cell below**, changing the second line to `sale_prices = prices[:]`, and
       run both again. `[:]` makes a copy of the list, where the first version made a
       second name for one list.

       refer to the same list on purpose?

    price and leave `prices` untouched. A `for` loop over positions, or a new list built
    from the old one, will both do it.

    ## ✏️ The Orders Table

    Each question is one of the moves from section 2, done to records.

    1. What is the **total freight** across all 30 orders?
    2. How many orders have **no `ShippedDate`**? That field holds `None` for them, and
       `if order["ShippedDate"] is None:` is how you ask.
    3. Which order has the **largest** freight, and what is it?

    **Check yourself:** 827.00 · 3 · order 10263 at 56.00.

    Then ask your agent, and ask which concepts its answer used.

    **Going further.** Look at the three orders with no `ShippedDate`. What do they have
    in common that the other 27 do not? The answer is not about shipping.

    # 6. The Portfolio

    Six holdings. **What does it cost to buy the whole portfolio?**

    Work the steps below in order. They are what to do with any problem you cannot yet
    write yourself.

    1. **By hand, no agent. Markdown cell.** Write how you would do it in plain words,
       three or four lines. *"For each holding, multiply... then..."*
    2. **Ask your agent to write it.** Read what comes back before you keep it.
    3. **Ask it to explain every detail.** Pick the line you would not have written and
       ask what it does and why it is there.
    4. **Ask it to set you a similar problem**, then solve that one yourself.

    **Check yourself: $116,302.70.**

    ## Going Further · The Same Question From a File

    The version above hands you the data already typed into Python. Real data arrives in
    a file. Run the cell below: it writes `portfolio.csv` into your project's `data/`
    folder, which is where [Your Python Project](/guides/python-projects/) says a data
    file goes, and makes that folder if you do not have one yet.

    Then work the same steps on this question: **open that file, read every line, and
    print the table and the total.** We have not reached files yet, so let the agent write
    that part and spend your time on steps 3 and 4.

    # 🚀 This Week's Work

    1. Everything above that is not marked **Advanced**, in this file, in your repository
       under `notebooks/`
    2. Your *One row is...* sentence
    3. Commit as you go, with messages that say what changed, and push before you stop

    **What you can do now:**

    - [ ] I can take one field out of one record, by name
    - [ ] I can state what one row of a table means, in a sentence
    - [ ] I can walk a collection and total the part of it that meets a condition
    - [ ] I can tell a missing value from a zero
    - [ ] I can hand a problem to an agent and check what comes back

    You will do the same things to a polars table in October and to a database table in
    November.
