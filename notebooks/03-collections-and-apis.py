    - [ ] I can change a dictionary, and read from it safely when a key may be missing
    - [ ] I can count with a dictionary
    - [ ] I can unpack a tuple into names
    - [ ] I can find the distinct values in a list, and what two lists share
    - [ ] I can choose between a list, a tuple, a dictionary and a set, and state why
    - [ ] I can request data from an API and read both its status code and its reply
