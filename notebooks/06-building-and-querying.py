    **The database is a file**, `data/ma-towns.duckdb`. It keeps the tables after this notebook stops, and any program that can read DuckDB can open it.

    Before you run the next cell, open `.gitignore` in the root folder of your repository and add this line, then commit it:

    ```
    *.duckdb*
    ```

    This notebook rebuilds the database from the data every time it runs, so the file itself does not belong in your repository.

    **One cell builds it.** It deletes the old file, opens a new one, creates the tables and loads them, and closes the file when the `with` block ends. Read the two `CREATE TABLE` statements against the diagram:

    - `name` is the **primary key** of each table. A county's name or a town's name names exactly one row, and the database refuses a second row with the same name.
    - `county` in `towns` is a **foreign key**. `REFERENCES counties(name)` makes the database refuse a town whose county is not in `counties`, so `counties` has to be filled first. This rule is called **referential integrity**.
    - `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` are rules about one column. A population has to be there and has to be more than zero.
    - `fips_code` is `UNIQUE`: it is not the key, and still no two counties can share one.
    - `government_abolished_year` has no `NOT NULL`. For the six counties that still have a county government, the year is empty, and that is a real answer.

    The last statement, `CREATE VIEW`, saves a query for later. Section 5 explains it.

    ## ✏️ A · A Table of Your Own

    **No agent for this one**, and no code completion either. When the editor suggests code in grey as you type, press `Esc` and keep typing your own.

    The course API keeps each town's figures for every year. Open [oim.zhili.dev/ma/towns/317/history](https://oim.zhili.dev/ma/towns/317/history), Wellesley's, in your browser and read what comes back.

    1. Write a `CREATE TABLE` for a table `town_bills`: one row for one town in one fiscal year, with the town's name, the year and the average single-family bill. Make the town's name a foreign key to `towns`.
    2. Choose the primary key, which takes two columns. A key of two columns goes on a line of its own at the end of the table, in the form `PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)`.
    3. Insert two of Wellesley's years by hand.
    4. Run all of it inside `with duckdb.connect(database) as _con:`, in a cell of its own, after the cell that builds the database.

    *Check yourself: inserting the same town and year a second time is refused with `Duplicate key`, and a town that is not in `towns` is refused with `foreign key`.*

    **Going further.** Load every year for one county's towns from the API, and find the town whose bill grew the most over 10 years.
