The shop takes new orders every day, and the tax figures change every year. **Save a copy to a file**, and the same analysis runs again on the same data, without a network, and anybody can open it in a spreadsheet.

    **No agent for this one**, and no code completion either. When the editor suggests code in grey as you type, press `Esc` and keep typing your own.

    `average_single_family_value_dollars` is the state's figure for what a single-family home in the town is worth on average, as the town assesses it for tax. Call a town a **million-dollar town** when that figure is $1,000,000 or more. Across the state the middle town is near $586,000.

    1. How many million-dollar towns are there, and which county has the most of them? Use `towns_from_file`, a `for` loop, `int()`, and a dictionary that counts, as in notebook 3. *Check yourself: 53 towns, and Middlesex has the most, with 14.*
    2. Which town has the fewest people, and which has the most? Loop over `towns_from_file` and keep the smallest and the largest you have seen so far, the way `find_largest` did in notebook 4. *Check yourself: Gosnold, with 62 people, and Boston, with 673,458.*
